        <p>In Spanish jurisdictions, there are regulations that require properties to use rectified invoices &ndash; that is, updated versions of existing invoices. Thankfully, Little Hotelier can help you by automating many of the tasks involved in creating and maintaining these rectified invoices.</p>

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction to rectified invoices</h2>

        <p>In short, a rectified invoice is an updated version of an existing invoice. It can therefore be used to keep track of changes to an invoice and also provide guests with an up-to-date version.</p>

        <p>In Spanish jurisdictions, properties are required by law to create a rectified invoice when specific details have been changed in a reservation. (These details will be covered below.) Furthermore, if the reservation changes again, a second rectified invoice needs to be made, and so on and so forth if additional changes are made.</p>

        <div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
            <div style="border: 1px solid #c2ecff;padding: 10px 15px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">âž• For example, let&rsquo;s say a customer makes a booking for a two-night stay, then you take their payment and email them an invoice. But the next day the customer calls to change their reservation to a three-night stay with breakfast included. Once you have taken their additional payment, you then need to email them a rectified invoice containing the updated details.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="details">Details that necessitate rectification</h2>

        <p>In other words, if specific details of a reservation are changed after an invoice has been made, Spanish laws mandate that a rectified invoice must be made.</p>

        <p>To help you comply with Spanish law, Little Hotelier will <a href="#rectify-automatic">automatically prompt</a> you to rectify an invoice for changes affecting any of the following details:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reservation dates</li>
            <li>Number of rooms and extras booked</li>
            <li>Price of rooms and extras</li>
            <li>Descriptions of rooms and extras</li>
            <li>Guest name</li>
            <li>Guest address</li>
            <li>Taxes applied to the booking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When any other invoice details are changed, you won&rsquo;t be prompted, however you can still rectify the invoice <a href="#rectify-manual">manually</a>, and due to Spanish law, you need to when any of the following details are changed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Legal name of your company</li>
            <li>Legal name of the customer</li>
            <li>Address of your company</li>
            <li>Address of the customer</li>
            <li>VAT number of your company</li>
            <li>VAT number of the customer</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
            <div style="border: 2px solid #fff2cc;padding: 10px 15px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">ðŸ’¡ &lsquo;VAT&rsquo; means &lsquo;Value-added tax&rsquo;; a tax applied to goods and services in some jurisdictions.</p>

        <h2 id="rectify">Rectify an invoice</h2>

        <p>There are several ways to rectify an invoice, but they all result in the same outcome. The main difference is whether you rectify an invoice after being <a href="#rectify-automatic">automatically prompted</a> or if you do it <a href="#rectify-manual">manually</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="rectify-automatic">Rectify when automatically prompted</h3>

        <p>As explained above, if <a href="#details">specific details</a> for a reservation have been changed, you will encounter prompts that enable you to rectify the invoice.</p>

        <p>To rectify an invoice using this prompt:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Calendar </strong>or <strong>Reservations</strong> page &gt; click on a reservation &gt; in the pop-up, click on the <strong>Invoices</strong> tab</li>
            <li>If <a href="#details">specific reservation details</a> have been changed, a prompt will appear enabling you to rectify the invoice</li>
            <li>In the prompt, click <strong>Rectify invoice</strong></li>
            <li>Enter an <strong>Invoice rectification note</strong> describing the changes that have been made to the invoice, then click <strong>Rectify invoice</strong></li>
            <li>You will see the rectified invoice appear below in the <strong>Older Invoices</strong> and <strong>Invoice History</strong> sections</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="rectify-manual">Rectify manually&nbsp;</h3>

        <p>If changes are made to any of the details not included in <a href="#details">this list</a>, you won&rsquo;t be prompted to rectify the invoice and you&rsquo;ll have to do it manually instead. Here&rsquo;s how.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Calendar </strong>or <strong>Reservations</strong> page &gt; click on a reservation &gt; in the pop-up, click on the <strong>Invoices</strong> tab</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Current invoice</strong> section, click <strong>rectify invoice</strong></li>
            <li>In the <strong>Rectify invoice</strong> pop-up, enter an explanation of what has been changed in the invoice, then click <strong>Rectify invoice</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="faqs">Frequently asked questions</h2>

        <h3 id="faq-1">Is Little Hotelier compliant with Spanish laws about invoice numbering?</h3>

        <p>Yes, invoices and rectified invoices are numbered in compliance with Spanish laws. These laws mandate that invoices must a) be numbered using a specific format, b) must not have any missing numbers in the sequence, and c) that rectified invoice numbers must use a prefix to indicate that the invoice has been rectified. (For this, we use the &ldquo;R-&rdquo; prefix.)</p>
